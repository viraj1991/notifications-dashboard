## 🔄 Key Design Decisions

-> State Management: React Context with useMemo for efficient derived state (filtered notifications, KPIs, chart data).

-> Data Fetching: Custom hook useNotifications handles API calls.

-> Race-Condition Handling on Refresh: Uses AbortController to cancel in-flight requests. Rapid refresh clicks abort previous fetches, ensuring only the latest response updates the state and preventing stale/mixed data.

-> Filtering: Central AND logic applied to all components (KPIs, charts, table).

-> UI: Tailwind CSS for styling, Lucide icons for modern visuals, Recharts for charts.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

```

## 🔄 Limitations

-> Read/unread state is client-side only (resets on refresh).

-> No pagination in the notifications table.

-> No persistence or backend integration.

## 🔄Future Improvements

-> Persist read state with localStorage.

-> Add table pagination or virtualization.
